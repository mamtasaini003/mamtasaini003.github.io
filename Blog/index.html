    <h1>Neural Operator: Revolutionizing Scientific Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
        Neural Operators are a new class of deep learning models designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Unlike traditional neural networks, which approximate finite-dimensional functions, neural operators can generalize across different input functions, making them powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and other scientific problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Neural Operators?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They enable fast and accurate solutions to complex PDEs.</li>
        <li>Generalize well to unseen domains and boundary conditions.</li>
        <li>Reduce computational cost compared to classical numerical solvers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        The most popular neural operator architecture is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which leverages Fourier transforms to efficiently learn global representations. Other variants include DeepONet and Graph Neural Operators.

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Weather prediction</li>
        <li>Fluid dynamics</li>
        <li>Material science</li>
        <li>Biological systems modeling</li>
    </ul>
